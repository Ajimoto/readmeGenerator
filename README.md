## Description <a id = 'description'></a>
    
    This README generator is a great tool to have if you are pumping out a lot of projects like we are in this coding bootcamp. I wish this was the first project that we did. If it was, than maybe id get a better score on some of this stuff. Oh well, such is life. Anyways, this README is actually generated using this exact app. Pretty pretty cool. This Application uses node js and inquirer(npm) to ask the user a series of questions. these answers are then taken and plugged into a prebuilt README doc. you can then alter it after. or overwrite it. whatever you want. its your life.
    
## Installation instructions <a id = 'installation'></a>
    
    pull the github repo and run npm init. Then install inquirer using "npm i inquirer@8". To run the application, type "node index.js" into the command line while in the index.js file.
